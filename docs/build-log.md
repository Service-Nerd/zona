# Zonna build-log

Raw learning notes, one entry per ship. Newest first. Dev / product / AI-building
angle. Feeds the weekly DHTB LinkedIn build-in-public posts — keep it honest, keep
it specific, no polish. The content system adds the voice.

## 2026-09-07 — BUILD-LOG-01 · The ship step that records what the ship taught

**Shipped:** `/ship` now has a mandatory final step that appends a raw learning entry to `docs/build-log.md`, and the file is seeded.

**Dev learning:** Two placement details did real work here. First, the file has to live at `/docs/` root, not `/docs/releases/` — `/docs/releases/` is excluded from the Claude-project sync, so the obvious home (next to backlog.md and roadmap.md) is the one place the content job structurally cannot read. Second, a skill's frontmatter `description` is what the router matches on. I changed the skill's job and nearly left the description saying "move a backlog item to feature-registry" — the new step would have existed in the file and never been the reason the skill got picked. If you change what a skill does, change how it advertises itself in the same edit.

**Product/creator learning:** I had three docs answering "what are we doing" (roadmap), "what's the spec" (backlog), and "what exists, free or paid" (feature-registry). Nothing answered "what did that cost me to learn." That's the only one of the four that's worth anything to anyone outside the project, and it was the one I wasn't writing down. The registry is for me; the build-log is the only artefact aimed outward.

**AI-building learning:** The spec I was handed had its two most important rules — "raw notes, not marketing" and "specific beats smooth" — in the framing prose *above* the block marked "paste this into your ship skill." Pasting the block verbatim, which is exactly what an agent optimising for faithfulness does, would have dropped both. The lesson: a spec written for a human reader carries load-bearing content outside the code fence, and "do exactly what the paste says" is not the same as "do what the spec means." Worth reading the whole message before executing the part with the copy button on it.

**The honest bit:** This has no mechanical backstop and I should say so rather than pretend otherwise. Every other guard in this repo is enforced by a hook or a failing test — the deload cadence, the coaching-doctrine gate, the config-principle sync. This one runs only when the model invokes `/ship`, and `/ship` only fires for items tracked in the backlog. This very change wasn't in the backlog, so nothing would have prompted the entry you're reading; I wrote it because I was already looking at it. By my own repo's standard — "a rule that holds only while someone remembers is not a rule" — this is currently not a rule. Separately: four releases landed this morning (the ADR-021/022 engine wave, §88 `cv_intervals`, the SEO plan pages) and every one of them predates this step, so their learnings are gone. Decided not to backfill rather than reconstruct them from diffs and pass inference off as recall.

**Hook material:** Four releases shipped before lunch. Zero of them left any record of what they taught. The fifth one was a file whose only job is to stop that happening — and it still isn't enforced by anything but memory.

**Postable?:** yes — the AI-building angle (load-bearing instructions living outside the paste block) and the honest bit (I built a discipline tool with no enforcement, in a repo whose whole doctrine is that unenforced rules decay) are both real and both specific.
