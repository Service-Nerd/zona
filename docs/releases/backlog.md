## v1 App Store Launch Roadmap

### Decisions resolved

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| D1 | **StoreKit (Apple IAP) vs web checkout** | ✅ RevenueCat + StoreKit 2 for iOS; Stripe for web. See ADR-005. |
| D2 | **Upgrade prompt UX** | ✅ Dedicated full screen (`UpgradeScreen`). Shipped. |
| D3 | **Gist → Supabase migration timing** | ✅ Before launch. Required for onboarding. |
| D4 | **Final pricing** | ✅ £7.99/month, £59.99/year. Parameterised in `lib/brand.ts` — never hardcoded. |
| D5 | **Canonical tagline** | ✅ **"Slow down. You've got a day job."** — all surfaces. Speaks directly to the target user's identity; names a person, not just a training approach. "Slow down. You're not Kipchoge." demoted to brand statement (editorial/App Store only). "Do less. Improve more.", "The slowest way to get faster.", and "effort-first training" retired. All strings live in `lib/brand.ts`. |
| D6 | **Monthly price** | ✅ £7.99/month, £59.99/year. Hold. Parameterised so it can be adjusted in `lib/brand.ts` without a search-replace. Annual discount currently 37% (category norm 44–49%) — revisit after first 100 paid users. |
| D7 | **Marketing site** | ✅ In-app Next.js page (replaces `app/page.tsx` redirect). Deferred — ships post-launch Phase 1 compliance. Not a separate domain. |
| D8 | **Zone discipline score for free users** | ✅ **Locked teaser on Coach tab.** Free users see the score category (zone discipline) in a locked/blurred state with upgrade CTA. Does not expose paid data. Mirrors the wizard teaser card pattern. Makes the upgrade value tangible without giving away the coaching signal. |
| D9 | **"effort-first training" sub-tagline** | ✅ Removed. Replace all instances with `BRAND.tagline` from `lib/brand.ts`. OrientationScreen is the only current location. |

---

### Phase 1 — Legal & Platform Compliance
**All P0. Apple will reject without every item here.**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Sign in with Apple | 🔲 Not Started | Apple §5.1.1d — mandatory when any other social login is present (Google OAuth is). |
| Account deletion flow | ✅ Shipped | Me screen → `DeleteAccountScreen` → `/api/delete-account` → cascade delete session_completions + subscriptions + user_settings + auth user. |
| Terms of Service | 🔲 Not Started | Required for any app with accounts or IAP. Write, host at public URL, link pre-login alongside privacy policy. |
| Privacy policy hosted | 🔲 Not Started | Page is built (`/privacy`). Needs to be live at `zona.app/privacy` before submission. |
| StoreKit 2 integration **or** External Purchase Entitlement | 🔲 Not Started | Depends on D1 above. If IAP: implement StoreKit 2 purchase + receipt validation. If web checkout: apply for entitlement — not guaranteed and slow. |
| Subscription terms disclosure UI | 🔲 Not Started | Apple requires price, billing frequency, 14-day trial length, and auto-renewal terms shown before user subscribes. |
| App Store Connect setup | 🔲 Not Started | Active developer account, app record, subscription product (ID + pricing tiers + trial config), screenshots for all required device sizes, App Store description and keywords. |

---

### Phase 2 — Infrastructure
**Blocks all new-user flows. Must ship before Phase 3.**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Subscription webhooks | ✅ Shipped | `/api/webhooks/stripe` + `/api/webhooks/revenuecat`. `subscriptions` table live in Supabase. ADR-005. |
| Gist → Supabase plan storage | ✅ Shipped | `plans` table with RLS. `fetchPlanForUser` + `savePlanForUser` in `lib/plan.ts`. Auto-migration from gist_url/plan_json on first load — all 4 existing users migrated transparently. Contract: `docs/contracts/api/plan-fetch.md`. Known gap: admin impersonation falls back to gist_url for migrated users (needs service-role admin route, tracked as tech debt). |
| Reverse trial infrastructure | ✅ Shipped | `lib/trial.ts` — `isTrialActive()` + `hasPaidAccess()`. `trial_started_at` set on first load. Gates on `/api/generate-plan`, `/api/claude`, `/api/strava/callback`. `UpgradeScreen` (dedicated screen, D2 resolved). `/api/checkout` stub ready for Stripe wiring. Migration: `20260422_trial_started_at.sql` — apply in Supabase. |

---

### Phase 3 — Onboarding
**The core new-user journey. No new user can reach the product without this.**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Rule-based plan engine | ✅ Shipped | `lib/plan/ruleEngine.ts` + `lib/plan/enrich.ts` + `lib/plan/generate.ts`. Hybrid architecture: rule engine always runs; AI enricher runs for trial/paid (silent fallback). Route rewritten to remove 403 for free users. `lib/trial.ts` adds `getUserTier()`. |
| Generating Ceremony | ✅ Shipped | `components/GeneratingCeremony.tsx`. Skeleton shimmer + staged ZONA copy + phase-arc reveal (80ms stagger). Tier-divergent: 3-line/1.8s-min for free, 5-line/3.6s-min for paid/trial. Replaces interim spinner. |
| Wizard tier-divergence | ✅ Shipped | R23b: one-question-per-screen sub-step wizard. 8 steps (free) / 12 steps (paid/trial). Teaser card on constraints step for free users. Slide transitions, progress dots, OptionCard selectors. |
| R0.5 — Onboarding flow | ✅ Shipped | New user → auto-route to wizard (empty plan detection). Wizard state persisted in sessionStorage (survives back-nav + upgrade flow). Upgrade-from-wizard routing: after UpgradeScreen, draft resumes wizard. Plan archive: previous plan archived to `plan_archive` table before overwrite. OrientationScreen shown post-save. Welcome screen bug fixed (new users skip the "Your plan is ready" screen). Migration: `20260424_plan_archive.sql`. |

---

### Phase 4 — Pre-submission Quality

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| TestFlight beta | 🔲 Not Started | Internal testing on device before public submission. |
| Full journey test | 🔲 Not Started | Tested end-to-end with agent-browser: create account → onboarding → plan on screen → log session → post-log reflect → simulate trial end → attempt paid feature → upgrade prompt. |
| App Store assets | 🔲 Not Started | Screenshots (all required device sizes), preview video (optional), keywords, App Store description copy. |

---

## GTM & Commercial

Findings from the 2026-04-22 GTM audit (`docs/gtm/audit-2026-04-22.md`). Ordered by impact × ease. Items marked **pre-launch** must ship before App Store submission; items marked **post-launch** follow the store release.

### Decisions behind this section
D5–D9 resolved above. Key: tagline is "Slow down. You've got a day job." everywhere; all brand strings and pricing live in `lib/brand.ts`; zone discipline score shown as locked teaser to free users.

### Pre-launch GTM — Ship before App Store submission

| # | Item | Effort | Tier | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| GTM-01 | **Brand constants rollout** | S | FREE (infra) | ✅ Shipped. `lib/brand.ts` created and wired to: login tagline, loading screen, welcome screen, OrientationScreen (replaces "effort-first training"), push notification title, UpgradeScreen pricing. |
| GTM-02 | **Copy fixes — voice batch** | S | FREE | ✅ Shipped. All 7 strings replaced. See list below. |
| GTM-03 | **UpgradeScreen rewrite** | S | PAID | ✅ Shipped (copy + feature list). "Get Zona Premium" → "Start your subscription". "BEST VALUE" → `PRICING.annual.savingLabel`. Feature list reordered: weekly zone coaching first. Remaining: trial loss framing variant (GTM-04). |
| GTM-04 | **UpgradeScreen — trial loss framing** | S | PAID | ✅ Shipped. `trialExpired` state tracked in DashboardClient, passed to UpgradeScreen. When expired: headline "Your coaching has paused.", sub "14 days done. Here's what stopped.", amber-accented LOSSES list (zone coaching, weekly reports, session feedback, plan adjustments). Gain framing unchanged for non-expired gate. |
| GTM-05 | **Zone discipline teaser (Coach tab, free users)** | M | TIER-DIVERGENT | ✅ Shipped. Coach tab now always visible in More nav for all users. Free users see `CoachTeaser` component: locked report card anatomy (muted/dimmed), locked zone discipline + load ratio stats (—), teal-accent teaser card with upgrade CTA. Paid users see full `CoachScreen` unchanged. |
| GTM-06 | **Post-session Strava prompt (free users)** | S | TIER-DIVERGENT | ✅ Shipped. Prop chain: DashboardClient → SessionScreen → SessionPopupInner. Free users see "Connect Strava to see how your HR compared. →" below the Done button in the reflect view. Taps to upgrade screen (Strava is PAID). |
| GTM-07 | **OG / social image** | S | FREE (ops) | ✅ Shipped. Dynamic `app/api/og/route.tsx` using `next/og` ImageResponse (edge runtime). 1200×630, navy bg, teal left accent bar, Space Grotesk wordmark + tagline from `BRAND`.

#### GTM-02 copy fixes detail

| Surface | File | Current | Replace with |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|

| Skip confirm | `DashboardClient.tsx` line ~1989 | "Mark this session as skipped? It will show in your log." | "Skip it. It'll stay in your log." |
| Coach empty state | `DashboardClient.tsx` line ~3681 | "Log some sessions and runs to generate this week's coaching report." | "Log a few sessions first. The report needs something to work with." |
| Plan generation error | `GeneratePlanScreen.tsx` line ~578 | "Could not generate plan" | "Something went wrong building the plan." |
| Teaser card CTA | `GeneratePlanScreen.tsx` line ~329 | "Free trial →" | "Upgrade to personalise →" |

### Post-launch GTM — After App Store release

| # | Item | Effort | Tier | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| GTM-08 | **Marketing site (app/page.tsx)** | M | FREE | High | Replace dashboard redirect with one-page site: overtraining thesis, Zona voice, single CTA (sign up / download). Uses `lib/brand.ts` for all copy. Screenshots: session card, reflect view, coach screen. Must exist before any paid acquisition or press. |
| GTM-09 | **Trial expiry email** | M | PAID | High | Single Zona-voice email at trial day 14. Subject and body reference zone discipline coaching specifically — not abstract features. "Your zone coaching pauses today." Include upgrade CTA. Requires email platform (Resend or Supabase Edge Function + SMTP). |
| GTM-10 | **Trial nudge email (day 11)** | S | PAID | Medium | "3 days of full access left." Zona voice. Links to UpgradeScreen. Ships with GTM-09 — same infrastructure. |
| GTM-11 | **Pricing review** | — | — | Low | Annual discount currently 37% vs category norm 44–49%. Monthly is parameterised via `lib/brand.ts` — can raise to £9.99/month (50% annual discount) without a code search-replace. Revisit after first 100 paid conversions. |

## Post-testing UX Backlog (2026-04-24)

Items identified from device testing. Decisions logged in `docs/alignment/phase-4-decisions.md`.

| # | Item | Effort | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|--------|----------|-------|
| UX-01 | **Review name/email fields on Profile screen** | S | Low | Name is actively used (greeting, initials, header). Email is a no-op — auth identity can't be changed without re-verification flow. Decision: keep for now; review whether email field should be read-only or removed before launch. |
| UX-02 | ~~**Branding task: review brandStatement on login footer**~~ | S | Low | ✅ Done. brandStatement updated to "You can't outrun your easy days." Removed from login (tagline owns that space). Kept on privacy footer + meta. |
| UX-03 | ~~**Header analysis — complete before building**~~ | S | Medium | ✅ Done. Plan: race name as title, week+days as sub. Profile: text back-arrow, first name as title, race sub. Coach: week format aligned. Decisions 19–21. |

## R23 Rebuild — In Progress (2026-04-25)

Rebuild of the rule engine and configuration based on a coaching audit. Architectural rebuild, not a tuning job. End state: all coaching constants in a single config file, a session catalogue table replaces generic "quality" sessions, distance-specific plan signatures drive differentiation, universal run format template, feature gates implementing reverse trial Option A.

**Doctrine documents:**
- `docs/canonical/CoachingPrinciples.md` — the constitution (18 principles)
- `docs/canonical/session-catalogue.md` — domain doc for the 14 sessions
- `docs/architecture/ADR-009-config-driven-generation.md`
- `docs/architecture/ADR-010-session-catalogue.md`

**Decisions captured (2026-04-25):**
- Marathon stays PAID (not free per spec).
- Trial start trigger stays on first dashboard load (not first plan generation per spec).
- HR zones: adopt spec Z1–Z5 straight; display + scoring both at 70% HRR easy cap.
- Phase distribution: 35/35/15/taper (per spec).
- Taper duration: 10/14/21/28 days by distance (per spec).
- Quality cap: max 2 per week (override spec's 3 for experienced).
- Hard→long gap: 48 h (override spec's 24 h — typo).
- PlanMeta legacy: hard-remove `motivation_type` and `training_style`.
- SessionType vs catalogue category: two orthogonal taxonomies kept separate.

**Phases:**
| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 — Pre-flight audit | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 0.5 — Documentation updates | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 1 — Foundation: config + catalogue | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 — Consumer migration | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3 — New coaching rules | ✅ Complete (3.1–3.11) |
| Phase 4 — Universal run format composer | ✅ Logic complete; UI integration deferred (`docs/alignment/phase-4-ui-followup.md`) |
| Phase 5 — Wizard changes | ⏸ Deferred — see `docs/alignment/phase-5-wizard-followup.md` |
| Phase 6 — Feature gates (Option A) | ✅ Server-side helper shipped; day-15 UI deferred (`docs/alignment/phase-6-gates-followup.md`) |
| Phase 7 — Validation matrix | ✅ 11/11 cases pass; intensity dist flagged as known engine gap |
| Phase 8 — Release wrap | ✅ Complete |

**Known gaps for follow-up:**
1. Wizard UI updates (Phase 5) — needs browser-in-loop session.
2. Day-15 transition UI (Phase 6.3) — needs frontend-design skill + browser verification.
3. Session card UI integration with `composeSession()` (Phase 4.2) — needs design rationale + browser verification.
4. Intensity distribution gap — engine produces ~90% easy across all distances; spec targets 75–88%. To hit targets the engine would need to schedule more quality minutes (longer quality sessions, or one extra quality session in build phase). Coaching decision; not a regression.
5. R20 reshape API routes still call `hasPaidAccess()` — could migrate to `isFeatureAllowed('dynamic_reshape_r20')` for clarity.

**Out of scope (confirmed):**
- R20 reshaping logic (downstream concern; rebuild does not touch).
- R24 multi-race (not enabled).
- R21 strength stubs (remain as stubs).
- INV-PLAN-007 (zone/HR as strings — unchanged).
- 14-day trial timer mechanism (only the post-trial gate categories change, via Option A).

## R23 Rebuild — Deferred Items

Captured 2026-04-25 during follow-up audit. Each has a clear next step and ownership.

### R23-D1 — Tier 2 wizard fields (engine consumer required first)

| Field | Status | Engine work needed | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `treadmill_primarily` (boolean) | Deferred | (a) bias catalogue selection away from `aerobic_hills` when true; (b) coach note on quality sessions: "outdoor only — skip strides on a treadmill". Touches `selectCatalogueSession` filter and `makeQualitySession` notes. | Medium — affects coaching quality for treadmill users |
| `longest_run_ever_km` (number) | Deferred — **needs product decision** | No clear engine consumer exists. Options: (a) widen week 1–2 long-run cap to `max(longest_recent × 1.10, longest_ever × 0.7)`; (b) peak-volume sanity check (don't prescribe a long run more than 30% above ever-longest); (c) abandon as a wizard input | Low — feature has no consumer until decision made |

**Why deferred:** Wizard fields without engine consumers add friction with zero value. Each requires a small coaching-design decision before the wizard work is worth shipping.

### R23-D2 — Catalogue lookup for legacy plans

**Status:** Deferred, recommend abandon

The Phase 4.2 session structure block uses `V1_SESSION_CATALOGUE.find(r => r.name === session.label)` to enrich the rendering. Pre-rebuild plans (generated before 2026-04-25) use legacy labels ("Tempo run", "Cruise intervals", "Tempo run — short") — these don't match catalogue names, so the structure block falls back to a generic main-set description.

**Why abandon:** Legacy plans expire as users regenerate. Building a `legacy_label → catalogue.id` mapping table is reverse-engineering work for a shrinking population.

### R23-D3 — Surface `compressed` flag in UI

**Status:** Deferred, needs design rationale

The R23 rebuild populates `meta.compressed = true` when the 10% volume cap prevents a plan reaching its target peak volume (e.g. returning runner with very low starting volume + short plan window). Currently invisible to users.

**Possible UX:**
- "Plan compressed" eyebrow on Plan screen header
- Coach note: "Your timeline is tight — we couldn't fully ramp to your target volume. The plan still works, just more conservative than ideal."
- Restraint card variant on Today screen for compressed plans

**Why deferred:** Needs design rationale (`frontend-design` skill) and copy review before shipping. No SLA — users with compressed plans don't experience anything broken; they just get a more conservative ramp.

### R23-D4 — Intensity distribution coaching tune

**Status:** Deferred — coaching decision required

Phase 7 validation shows the engine produces ~90% easy across all distances vs spec targets 75–88%. The gap is consistent: **not enough quality minutes scheduled** relative to easy/long minutes.

**Two ways to close the gap:**

1. **More quality sessions per week** — bump `QUALITY_SESSIONS_PER_WEEK_MAX.intermediate` from 2 to 3 for build/peak phases. Keeps spec-compliant for experienced runners but contradicts CoachingPrinciples §8 (current rule: max 2 because the 3rd quality session is rarely accommodated by life).
2. **Longer quality sessions** — extend tempo blocks from 30 min to 45+ min, double interval reps. More quality minutes per session.

**Trade-off:** option 1 is more "polarised training" (more frequent stress); option 2 is more conservative time-on-feet but bigger single sessions. Both move the needle.

**Why deferred:** Coaching philosophy decision, not a refactor. Owner: Russ.

### R23-D5 — F1: ReshapeScreen 403 has no upgrade CTA

**Status:** Deferred — defense-in-depth only

If a free user reaches `screen=reshape` via URL manipulation, the API returns 403 `{ error: 'Subscription required' }`. The screen renders the error message but with no "Upgrade" CTA. Primary gate is the MeScreen UI hide on `hasPaidAccess`, which works correctly.

**Fix:** When `error === 'Subscription required'`, show "See plans" CTA → `setScreen('upgrade')`. Two-line change.

**Why deferred:** Belt-and-braces only. No production user can hit this via supported flows.

### R23-D6 — F2: Free users can generate new plans post-trial (Option A semantic gap)

**Status:** Deferred — **needs product decision**

`/api/generate-plan` does not block free users from regenerating. They get rule-engine output (no AI enrichment, no Marathon/50K/100K). This is **today's behaviour** and matches the original feature-registry intent: "Generic plan templates (5K/10K/HM) via rule-based engine — FREE".

**Conflict:** Phase 6 follow-up doc (`phase-6-gates-followup.md`) lists `new_plan_generation` as paid-only with drafted paywall copy: *"New plan needs Premium. Your existing one stays as-is."*

**Decision needed:** Strict (free users keep trial-era plan; can't regenerate) or Lenient (free users can regenerate rule-engine plans; AI + ultras stay paid)?

| Strict | Lenient |
|---|---|
| Cleaner upsell — "fresh start" is part of premium | Brand promise — free users always have a tailored plan |
| Code change: detect `is_regeneration` (or existing plan) in route → 403 | No code change — current behaviour |

**Why deferred:** Commercial choice, not a refactor.

### R23-D7 — `length.ts` cleanup tracking

**Status:** Resolved this session — `taperWeeks` removed from `DistanceConfig` (Group A2). No further action.

---

## R23 Rebuild — Active Carry-Over

Items still queued for hands-on attention after the rebuild:

| Item | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Browser-verify Phase 5 + Phase 4.2 + Phase 6.3 changes after Vercel deploy | Russ | Awaiting deploy + manual check |

### R20 — Dynamic Plan Reshaping ✅ Complete
**Tier:** PAID | **Status:** Fully shipped
- Automatic triggers: `load_spike`, `zone_drift`, `shadow_load`, `ef_decline` — auto-apply low-risk, confirm-required for significant
- Phase-aware: taper blocked, peak phase preserves quality sessions on EF decline
- Plan adjustment API: `/api/adjust-plan` + `/api/confirm-adjustment` + `/api/revert-adjustment`
- Hard caps: max 2 adjustments/week, 3-week taper protection, 10% volume cap, 48hr quality spacing
- User-initiated reshape: Me screen → Training Intelligence → "Reshape plan" → `ReshapeScreen`
- **Parked — plan adaptation triggers (v1.1+):** See `docs/alignment/plan-adjustments-parked.md` for full product spec. Five triggers below are not built — infrastructure exists but nothing generates them yet.

| Parked trigger | Description | Target version |
|---|---|---|
| Session move → rebalance | User drags session to new day; hard/easy alternation preserved | v1.1 |
| Skip with reason | User marks session skipped with reason; plan responds (make up / push / absorb) | v1.2 |
| Silent miss detection | Day passes with no log; morning-after prompt | v1.2 |
| Fatigue-driven softening | 3+ consecutive Heavy/Wrecked logs → soften upcoming sessions | v1.3 |
| RPE disconnect | RPE 8+ on easy run → coach note only (no plan change — decision made) | v1.3 |

### R21 — Strength Sessions
**Tier:** FREE (display stubs) / PAID (dynamic)
- Flesh out strength session stubs in plan JSON
- Session cards with appropriate UI treatment
- Currently: admin-only, hidden from public plan + today view

### R22 — Blockout Days
**Tier:** PAID
- User marks days unavailable; plan reshapes around them

### R23b — Plan Generator Wizard UI ✅ Complete
**Tier:** PAID | **Status:** Shipped
- One question per screen (8 steps free / 12 steps paid)
- Slide + fade transitions, expanding pill progress dots
- Large OptionCard selectors for goal, hard-sessions, terrain, training-style
- SessionStorage persistence maintained; same API and data model

### R24 — Multi-Race Support
**Tier:** PAID
- Support multiple target races per user (A/B race hierarchy)
- **Schema path**: Current `meta.race_date` and `meta.race_name` are canonical primary-race fields and remain unchanged. R24 will introduce `meta.races: Race[]` as a non-breaking additive field. `Plan.phases[]` (added in R23) provides the structure for multi-race periodisation — phases can be anchored to different race targets.

## Scoped But Unscheduled — Ops

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Rename Vercel project to `zona` (or `zona-app`) | Currently `zona-service-nerds-projects` — taken at rename time. Pick a cleaner name when available, then update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` env var, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/releases/backlog.md`, and `app/api/checkout/route.ts` fallback. |

## Tech Debt

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Strava token refresh | ✅ Done — `lib/strava.ts` `getStravaToken()` + `/api/strava/refresh` route. Full refresh flow in place. |
| `login/page.tsx` hardcoded values | ✅ Audited and fixed — heading, tagline, copy, spinner all corrected |
| `PlanCalendar` `stravaRuns` prop | Accepted but unused in WeekCard — remove or wire up |
| Hardcoded font strings | ✅ Done — `StravaPanel.tsx` (20), `PlanChart.tsx` (2), `DashboardClient.tsx` (1) all replaced with `var(--font-ui)` / `var(--font-brand)`. Zero remaining across `app/` and `components/`. |
| `nextMonday()` UTC drift in `route.ts` | ✅ Fixed — route.ts rewritten in R23; now uses `lib/plan/length.ts` `parseDateLocal()` throughout |
| Tier-divergent rendering utility | Once a second tier-divergent component lands (after `GeneratingCeremony.tsx`), centralise the `tier` prop pattern into a shared context or typed prop convention. Document as a pattern in `ui-patterns.md`. |
| API contract docs (10 routes) | Missing `docs/contracts/api/` entries for: `analyse-run`, `adjust-plan`, `confirm-adjustment`, `checkout`, `recalibrate-zones`, `revert-adjustment`, `delete-account`, `weekly-report`, `push/subscribe`, `push/send-weekly-report`. Write after UX rework — route shapes may change. |
| Plan history UI | Data is archived to `plan_archive` table (migration `20260424`). UI (browse archived plans + restore) deferred post-launch. Schema has `race_name`, `race_date`, `archived_at` for future list display. |
